# Vue-Jack üÉè

It's a simple Blackjack clone written in Vue3/Nuxt3.  
Inspiration for the game logic (also the card images) comes from [ImKennyYip](https://github.com/ImKennyYip/black-jack).  
However, the game logic has been adapted and in the future I would like to add a multiplayer with [socket.io](socket.io).
